    <h1>Features of HTML5</h1>
    <p>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language, and it is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications. HTML5 is the 5th version of HTML. With invent of features in HTML5, it’s not only possible to create better websites, but we can also create dynamic websites. <br><br>

        1. Intro of audio and video: 
        Audio and Video tags are the two major addition to HTML5. It allows developers to embed a video or audio on their website. HTML5 video can use CSS and CSS3 to style the video tag. You can change the border, opacity, reflections, gradients, transitions, transformations, and even animations. HTML5 makes adding video super-fast and without having to build a video player. This saves time for the developer and offers the client a superior and more affordable solution. <br><br>
        2. Vector Graphics:
        This is a new addition to the revised version which has hugely impacted the use of Adobe Flash in websites. It can be used to draw graphics with various shapes and colors via scripting usually JS. Vector graphics are scalable, easy to create and edit. It also supports interactivity and animation. Having a smaller file size makes transferring and loading graphics much faster on the web. That’s the reason why many people prefer to use vector graphics. <br><br>
