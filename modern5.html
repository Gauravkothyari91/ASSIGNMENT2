   <strong>5. Write a short note on the tab index.</strong> 
   <h1>Tab index</h1>
   <p>The tabindex global attribute allows developers to make HTML elements focusable, allow or prevent them from being sequentially focusable (usually with the Tab key, hence the name) and determine their relative ordering for sequential focus navigation. <br><br>
    It accepts an integer as a value, with different results depending on the integer's value:
<br>
    Note: If an HTML element renders and has tabindex attribute with any valid integer value, the element can be focused with JavaScript (by calling the focus() method) or visually by clicking with the mouse. The particular tabindex value controls whether the element is tabbable (i.e. reachable via sequential keyboard navigation, usually with the Tab key). <br>
    A negative value (the exact negative value doesn't actually matter, usually tabindex="-1") means that the element is not reachable via sequential keyboard navigation. <br>
    Note: tabindex="-1" may be useful for elements that should not be navigated to directly using the Tab key, but need to have keyboard focus set to them. Examples include an off-screen modal window that should be focused when it comes into view, or a form submission error message that should be immediately focused when an errant form is submitted. <br><br>
    tabindex="0" means that the element should be focusable in sequential keyboard navigation, after any positive tabindex values. The focus navigation order of these elements is defined by their order in the document source.
    A positive value means the element should be focusable in sequential keyboard navigation, with its order defined by the value of the number. That is, tabindex="4" is focused before tabindex="5" and tabindex="0", but after tabindex="3". If multiple elements share the same positive tabindex value, their order relative to each other follows their position in the document source. The maximum value for tabindex is 32767.
    If the tabindex attribute is included with no value set, whether the element is focusable is determined by the user agent. <br></p>
