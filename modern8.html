    <strong>8. Create a simple webpage with semantic HTML which has the header, main, and footer sections. The
        header section must contain links to navigate to different sections of the webpage. The main section
        must contain three subsections about what is HTML. What is semantic HTML and a list of commonly used
        semantic tags/ In the end, the footer section must contain your name.</strong>

<h2>HTML</h2>
<p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. Other technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a web page's appearance/presentation (CSS) or functionality/behavior (JavaScript).

    "Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single website or between websites. Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the Internet and linking it to pages created by other people, you become an active participant in the World Wide Web.
    
    HTML uses "markup" to annotate text, images, and other content for display in a Web browser. HTML markup includes special "elements" such as <head>, <title>, <body>, <header>, <footer>, <article>, <section>, <p>, <div>, <span>, <img>, <aside>, <audio>, <canvas>, <datalist>, <details>, <embed>, <nav>, <output>, <progress>, <video>, <ul>, <ol>, <li> and many others.
    
    An HTML element is set off from other text in a document by "tags", which consist of the element name surrounded by "<" and ">". The name of an element inside a tag is case-insensitive. That is, it can be written in uppercase, lowercase, or a mixture. For example, the <title> tag can be written as <Title>, <TITLE>, or in any other way. However, the convention and recommended practice is to write tags in lowercase. <br>

    <h2>semantic Html</h2>
    <p>In HTML, for example, the h1 element is a semantic element, which gives the text it wraps around the role (or meaning) of "a top level heading on your page."

        <h1>This is a top level heading</h1>
        Copy to Clipboard
        By default, most browser's user agent stylesheet will style an h1 with a large font size to make it look like a heading (although you could style it to look like anything you wanted).</p>

        <p>Common semantic HTML tags
            With the release of HTML5, there is an updated list of which semantic tags are valid and still used prominently in development projects today, including:
            <br>
            <article></article> and <section></section>
            Both of these elements can often be used to manage the same sections and be used interchangeably. However, it is important to keep in mind that the <article></article> tag is useful for being reusable and it is also considered independently distributable. A <section></section> tag, on the other hand, is typically used to group more than one piece or section of content.
            
            <header></header>
            The header section of a website is typically found at the top of a website. The header of a website will often include meta tag information, keywords, and even imported CSS files or style sheets. The header can also lay out the necessary groundwork for your website layout or design.
            
            <footer></footer>
            The <footer></footer> tag operates similar to the <header></header> tag, except the footer is typically found at the bottom of any web page. The footer of a website typically includes contact information, a site map, and additional links such as ones to social media sites to help tie the website together and boost SEO.
            
            <main></main>
            When you choose to use the <main></main> element tag, you signify the main body of text or content of a website's layout. Only use the <main></main> tag to host the inner paragraphs, written text, images, and inner content of your website. The <main></main> tag will always come after the <header></header> tag has been introduced and prior to the <footer></footer> tag of any page.
            
            <nav></nav>
            Developing a successful website requires an accessible and updated navigation section. When you are building a website of any kind, you will need to add navigation links to help users properly browse your site. The use of the tag <nav></nav> helps organize the particular section of a site designated for navigation links. Navigation menus, tables, and indexes are all possible with the <nav></nav> semantic HTML5 tag.  </p>
