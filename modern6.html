  <strong>6. list any 5 semantic tags in HTML along with their descriptions.</strong>  
  <h1>Semantic tag</h1>
  <p>Many web sites contain HTML code like: <div id="nav"> <div class="header"> <div id="footer"> to indicate navigation, header, and footer.

    In HTML there are some semantic elements that can be used to define different parts of a web page:  
    
    1. <article>
      The <article> element specifies independent, self-contained content.

      An article should make sense on its own, and it should be possible to distribute it independently from the rest of the web site.
      
      Examples of where the <article> element can be used:
      
      Forum posts
      Blog posts
      User comments
      Product cards
      Newspaper articles <br><br>
  
    2.<footer>
      The <footer> element defines a footer for a document or section.

        A <footer> element typically contains:
        
        authorship information
        copyright information
        contact information
        sitemap
        back to top links
        related documents
        You can have several <footer> elements in one document.

    3.<header>
      The <header> element represents a container for introductory content or a set of navigational links.

        A <header> element typically contains:
        
        one or more heading elements (<h1> - <h6>)
        logo or icon
        authorship information.

    4. <aside>
      The <aside> element defines some content aside from the content it is placed in (like a sidebar).

        The <aside> content should be indirectly related to the surrounding content.

    5. <nav>
      The <nav> element defines a set of navigation links.
        
    6. <figcaption>
      The <figcaption> tag defines a caption for a <figure> element. The <figcaption> element can be placed as the first or as the last child of a <figure> element.
